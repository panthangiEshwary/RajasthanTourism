<p ><font color="white" face="blackadder ITC" size="05">>Located in the heart of Jaipur, the City Palace of Jaipur was once the Maharajaâ€™s reign. The complex of the palace includes the Chandra Mahal and Mubarak Mahal and many other courtyards and buildings. Initially built by Sawai Jai Singh II between 1729 and 1732 AD, many additions have been made in the original architecture of the palace by the other rulers later in the 20th century. The architectural style of this old building was largely based on the blend of Mughal, Rajput and European styles. The Chandra Mahal of the complex has been now turned into a museum showcasing unique handcrafted products, uniforms of the rulers of ancient time and lots more related to the royal inheritance of the City Palace.</p>

<p>Chittaurgarh (Chittorgarh) fort is the personification of the high spirit, romance and pride of the Rajputs. It resounds with the history of sacrifice and heroism, evidences of which can be still witnessed within the frightening fort of Chittorgarh. This ancient fort is considered as one of the most stupendous forts of the country and a real pride of Rajasthan State. Located on the edge of approximately 180 meters high mound and covering over 700 acres of massive area, the fort was initially built by the Mauryans in the 7th century. However, more structures were added to it later on by the successive rulers of Mewar.</p>

<p>Sheesh Mahal or the Hall of Mirrors is situated at Amber fort in Jaipur. Build by Raja Man Singh in 1592 with red sandstone and white marble, the beauty of this fort is blown up by the Maotha Lake. Sheesh Mahal is one of the world famous forts because of its unique construction. The ceilings and walls of the hall are superbly covered with the mirrors that would reflect any splash of ray and light up the hall deliberately.</p>
