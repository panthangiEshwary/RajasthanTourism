<p>The Dilwara Temples or Delvada Temples are a group of svetambara Jain temples located about ​2 1⁄2 kilometres from the Mount Abu settlement, Rajasthan's only hill station. The earliest were built by Vimal Shah and supposedly designed or at least financed by Vastupala, Jain minister of Dholka. They date between the 11th and 16th centuries, forming some of the most famous monuments in the style of Māru-Gurjara architecture,[1] famous for their use of a very pure white marble and intricate marble carvings.They are a pilgrimage place for Jains, and a significant general tourist attraction.Although Jains built many temples at other places in Rajasthan, the Dilwara temples are believed to be the most impressive.
